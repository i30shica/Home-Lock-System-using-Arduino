# Home-Lock-System-using-Arduino
A smart security system built using Arduino Uno for real-time home safety monitoring and control.

🔐 Home Lock System using Arduino

A smart security system that uses an **Arduino Uno**, **keypad**, and **servo motor** to provide a password-protected locking mechanism for home doors. This project enhances traditional door locks with electronic security and can be easily customized or expanded for IoT-based access.

🧠 Project Overview

The system allows a user to **enter a passcode using a keypad**.
If the entered password is correct, the **servo motor rotates to unlock** the door; otherwise, it remains locked and displays an error on the LCD.

⚙️ Components Used

* Arduino Uno
* 4x4 Matrix Keypad
* 16x2 LCD Display
* Servo Motor
* Breadboard & Jumper Wires
* Power Supply (5V)

🧩 Features

* Password-based lock mechanism
* Real-time feedback via LCD display
* Secure access control for home safety
* Easy hardware setup and modular design
* Can be extended with IoT or fingerprint sensors

🛠️ How It Works

1. The system waits for user input from the keypad.
2. The input is compared with a pre-defined password in the Arduino code.
3. If matched, the servo rotates to unlock the door and shows “Access Granted”.
4. If incorrect, it shows “Access Denied” on the LCD.
